## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a research engineer in **machine learning** at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab in Paris. In the last few years, my work has centered around **model-based reinforcement learning** and **AutoML**. You can check out my papers [here]({{< ref "/papers.md" >}}).

Before joining Huawei, I completed my Phd on **unsupervised anomaly detection** at [Telecom ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/) in October 2017. During my PhD, I worked at the Airbus Group Innovations under the guidance of Vincent Feuillard. My academic supervisors were [StÃ©phan ClÃ©menÃ§on](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/) and [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/).

I also contributed to [**scikit-learn**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for a few years. Feel free to take a look at my [Github profile](https://github.com/albertcthomas) for more information.

On top of that, I like to write blog posts every now and then about the things I learn and try as part of my daily work. You can check out my blog posts [here]({{< ref "/blog" >}}).
