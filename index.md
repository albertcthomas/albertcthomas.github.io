I am currently working as a Research Engineer at Huawei Technologies in the Paris area.

I completed my Phd on unsupervised anomaly detection at [Telecom ParisTech](http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/) in October 2017. My supervisors were [Stéphan Clémençon](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~clemenco/Home.html) and [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/). This PhD was industry oriented with applications in maintenance and cybersecurity at the Airbus Group Innovations where I worked under the supervision of Vincent Feuillard.

I also contribute to [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a Python machine learning library. See my Github [profile](https://github.com/albertcthomas) for more information.
